    <h2> Joe</h2>
    <p>Hey Yall! My name is Joseph McIntyre but my friends call me Joe. I am from Fort Worth TX and this is my second semester at BYU-I. I have a twin brother, little, sister, and a little brother. I am also blessed with 5 awesome step siblings!
        some of my hobbies are mountain biking, aquariums, and video games. I love to go hiking and play games outside, especiually frisbee, volleyball, and football. I have been a member of the church my whole life and have not yet served my mission. 
         My major is computer science and I am going to stick to it because I love it!
