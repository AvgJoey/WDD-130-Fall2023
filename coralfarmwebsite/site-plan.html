      <h3>Coral Information</h3>
      <p>
        Corals are often misunderstood, people see them as plant-like objects. However, they are animals that are extremely complex, and every coral is completely different thatn its neighbor! Some corals can move around the sand bed and rock face on their foor, and some specialize in stinging prey and other corals for territory!
        The corals shown here are two different types, the top image is a Thirst Quencher Ricordea Mushroom Coral, and the bottom image is a Golden Torch Coral. Both of these corals are for sale here on our website!
        This page will teach about flow, lighting, and basic coral needs. Corals differ in their need of nuitrients, light, and flow depending on the species. The Mushroom coral, for example, prefers lower levels of light
        and lower, calmer flow. These corals are typically placed lower in the aqaurium or on the sandbed. The torch coral shown prefers more intense lighting and intense flow, as the flow moves around its
        tentacles allowing for nutrient and photosynthetic exchange.
